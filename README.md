# setCalculator: finding differences between multiple user-defined sets

## Assigned: Friday, 15 March 2024

## Due: Friday, 15 March 2024, by 11am

## Project Goals

+ To learn how to work together on code in groups.
+ To work with sets
+ To research set Python code using online searches.

## Instructions

Each person must turn in own activity using the code from group work. You will be editing the `main.py` in the directory, `setCalculator/setcalculator/`.

Choose a theme (such as film, the arts, sciences, etc.) from which to select elements (such as names, or other) to use to create `list`s for the activity. Be creative! Each member will create own list of elements to share with the group by Discord DM-ing.

In your `main.py`, hard-code the list of elements from each member of the group. The list should contain at least ten (10) elements related to your group's chosen theme. Write code to convert these `list`'s of elements into `set`'s using Python's `set()` function, or from Sympy's `FiniteSet()` function (choose one).

Note: Decide how your elements will look in text. Spell your elements in one word comprised of lowercase characters, involving camel casing (i.e., "johnSmith", "marieCurie"), to avoid complications when working with strings.

Do not tell anyone what your list elements are until you share your list with your group members using Discord. Be sure to get each list from your group members to add your own code to complete the challenges below.

To complete the challenges in your `main.py` file, you may need to look-up the code. Be sure to discuss your code with your group members to decide whether the code will complete the challenge.

## Execution of code

After you have edited the code in your `setCalculator/setcalculator/main.py` project file, use the following commands to run your project.

+ `poetry install`
+ `poetry run setcalculator`

## Deliverable

   * `setCalculator/setcalculator/main.py`

## Submission

As you are working, you are to commit and push regularly. The commands are the following.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m ``Your notes about commit here''
git push
```

After you have pushed your work to your repository, please visit the repository at the GitHub website (you may have to log-in using your browser) to verify that your files were correctly sent.

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade.

## GatorGrade Checking

You can also use `gatorgrade` to check the baseline requirements of this assignment by running the following command in your terminal:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

If `gatorgrade` shows that all checks pass, you will know that you have met baseline requirements of this project.

After you have pushed your work to your repository, please visit the repository at the GitHub website (you may have to log-in using your browser) to verify that your files were correctly sent.

## Seeking Assistance

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
